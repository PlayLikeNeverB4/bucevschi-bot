This is a Facebook Messenger bot used for programming contests reminders. It is written in NodeJS. In order to set it up locally you have to create a new bot on Facebook and then run `npm run dev`.

Until Oct 31, 2022 it was hosted on Heroku. Now it is hosted on a free-tier AWS EBS using a free Postgres database from [elephantsql](https://www.elephantsql.com).
